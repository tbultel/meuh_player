rpi-buildroot Meuh! Player
==========================

## Synopsis

This project is based on rpi-buildroot (https://github.com/gamaral/rpi-buildroot)

## Motivation

The aim is to demonstrate the power of buildroot to quickly build
a Web radio player, that boots fast (the radio starts to play in less than 20 seconds)

This is a proof of concept, but as it must be -fun- 
the target radio example is the famous http://www.radiomeuh.com
